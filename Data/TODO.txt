Things to do

BASIC MYSQL QUERY:

SELECT open FROM HistoricalPrices WHERE date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND now() AND symbol = 'AA';

EXAMPLE CODE TO USE IN JAVA:
    -Say you want to get the closing prices of the last 50 days from the stock AAPL (Apple)
    - Java code would be as follows:

        //First create a statement:
        Statement statement = con.createStatement();
        //Execute the statement!:
        ResultSet result = statement.executeQuery(INSERT IN HERE THE QUERY);

        //result will now contain all the information you have asked for
        //How to access this data?
        float data = result.getFloat("close");

        Opt.1)
        CAPM formula

        S    = stock return
        r    = risk-free rate = X Year U.S. Treasury securities rate
        b    = beta
        m    = return on market = X year average annual return of

                      S = r + b(m - r)
        (S - r)/(m - r) = b

        or...
        weekly returns over X years

        Sw = stock return % from previous weekly
        rw = market return % from previous weekly
        n  = number of week

        cov(Sw, rw) = Sum((Sw@n - SwBAR)(rw@n - rwBAR)) / (n - 1)
            var(rw) = Sum((rw@n - rwBAR)^2) / (n - 1)
                  b = cov(Sw, rw) / var(rw)
